⚙️ Setup & Customization Notes

1. 🧩 Folder Structure

Stick to the provided folder layout or simply clone this repo — both methods give you a complete, working ProjectUI setup.


2. 🪪 Logo Creation

You’ll find comments in your code marking where the logo logic starts and where it ends.
Use that section to create your own animated or static logo for your project.
This helps make your version of ProjectUI truly yours — sleek, unique, and personal. ✨

4. 🧭 Add Your Own Paths

In several files, comments clearly mark where to add or edit routes and paths for your own pages.
Follow those notes to connect new components, pages, or sections effortlessly.

5. ✏️ App Name Replacement

All instances of “ProjectUI” in the codebase can easily be replaced with your own web app name.
Each occurrence is clearly marked via inline comments — so rebranding is quick and consistent.

6. 💬 In-Code Comments & Guidance

Every component and page includes meaningful inline comments explaining what to edit, why, and how.
Follow them to adapt colors, text, structure, or animations with confidence.
